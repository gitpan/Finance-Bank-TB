This file was pre-historic, so still looked correct.

With modern perl and CPAN.pm you should be able to type:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
install Finance::Bank::TB

Or do it by hand as follows:

get the Finance-Bank-TB-x.xx.tar.gz file - use binary mode if FTP'ing.
  where x.xx is version number

Unpack it e.g.
                                  
gunzip -c Finance-Bank-TB-x.xx.tar.gz | tar xf - 
  or
tar zxf Finance-Bank-TB-x.xx.tar.gz

cd to the directory distribution unpacks to.

perl Makefile.PL
make 
make test (optional, but recomended)
make install
